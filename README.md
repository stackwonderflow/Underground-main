# Underground
A small console game

This is a simple console game called 'Underground.' 
In it, players can battle enemies that become progressively stronger.
Players can also collect items and use them. The random library is used to determine whether a player encounters enemies and items. 
It is also used to determine whether a player is able to strike enemies, block enemy attacks, or flee from combat.
The game ends when a player's health_stat reaches zero.

This was initially a final project for Code in Place.
